# trackbox-push

Our cutting-edge WordPress plugin is designed to help website owners streamline their Trackbox Push API integrations and take their website's functionality to the next level. With this plugin, users can easily add multiple API details and validate user data with ease.

When a user fills out the form on the front-end of the website, the plugin validates the input values and sends them to the appropriate API detail for processing. This is determined by the "ai" parameter, which identifies the URL of the page the user is on.

The plugin also features user-friendly input fields, with clear and concise labels, including "First Name", "Last Name", "Email", and "Phone Number". This makes it easy for users to input their information and reduces the likelihood of errors during the data collection process.

Once the user submits their information, the plugin displays a success message if the data is valid and the API detail processes the data successfully. If the data is not valid, the plugin displays an error message to the user, allowing them to correct any mistakes and resubmit their information.

Additionally, the plugin includes a blank div where users can see the API validation response, identified by the class "tp_api_response". This ensures transparency and allows users to see the response from the API detail.

Overall, our Trackbox Push API integration plugin is a must-have for website owners looking to streamline their API integrations and provide a seamless experience for their users. Try it out today and take your website's functionality to the next level!
