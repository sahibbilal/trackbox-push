Looking for a way to streamline Trackbox Push API integrations and make your WordPress site more powerful than ever? Look no further than our cutting-edge plugin!

Each API detail contains values such as "ai", "ci", "gi", "MPC_1" to "MPC_10", API key, username, and password. Users can add multiple API details, but only one API key can be used. On the front-end of the website, users are prompted to input their name, last name, email, and phone number. The URL of this page is identified by the "ai" parameter, which is used to determine which API detail to call.

When the user submits their information, the plugin validates the values and sends them to the appropriate API detail to be processed. If the values are valid, the API will send a response back to the plugin, which will then display a success message to the user. If the values are not valid, the API will send an error message back to the plugin, which will then display an error message to the user.

Overall, this plugin allows website owners to easily integrate multiple API details into their WordPress site, and provides a user-friendly interface for collecting user data and sending it to the appropriate API detail for processing.
